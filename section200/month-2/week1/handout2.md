# Handout 2

The following should be completed after reading Chapter 2 (A short tour of the predictive modeling process) of Applied Predictive Modeling.

### (1) In the “fuel economy” example, the concept of a linear and non-linear relationship between variables are introduced. Can you think of examples of some linear and non-linear relationships you would expect to see in data at Red Ventures?

### (2) A decision tree model is a simple and popular type of model. In the case of a 1-dimensional feature space, the model has the form

### (3) We were introduced to the notion of RMSE in this section. Does RMSE make sense for binary classification tasks? (That is, tasks where the label for each data point is 0 or 1) How else might you quantify performance of a classification model?
